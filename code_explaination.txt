Apartment Letter Generator

This Python script helps you quickly create personalized letters for apartment residents 
using a Word template and an Excel file with resident names.

What It Does:
- Reads apartment numbers and resident names from an Excel file.
- Replaces a placeholder in a Word template with each resident’s name.
- Creates one Word letter for every apartment.
- Uses a default greeting if the resident name is missing.

How It Works:
1. Setup
   - You need a Word template (template_letter.docx) with "Dear *name*," as a placeholder.
   - You also need an Excel file (resident_names.xlsx) with two columns: Apartment and Resident Name.

2. Output Folder
   - The script automatically creates a folder called apartment_letters_generated to save the letters.

3. Read Resident Names
   - The script loads your Excel file and makes a list of apartments and names.

4. Make Personalized Letters
   - Loops through all apartments (like A1, A2… B1, B2…)
   - If a resident’s name is in the Excel file, it uses it in the greeting ("Dear Haaland").
   - If no name is found, it uses a default greeting ("Dear resident of apartment A1,").

5. Save Letters
   - Each letter is saved as a Word file in the output folder with a name like Letter_Apartment_A1.docx.

6. Done!
   - The script prints a message for each letter it creates.
   - When finished, you have all letters ready in the output folder.
